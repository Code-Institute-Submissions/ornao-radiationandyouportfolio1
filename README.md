# Radiation & You

## Introduction

The purpose of this website is to give the user a brief and simple overview of the basics of radiation. As a trained healthcare professional in the radiology department, I have the knowledge and understanding of how radiation is used in hospitals; and I would like to share this information through HTML5 and CSS3 to the best of my ability. 

I work full-time in a childrenâ€™s hospital and hence this website will be catered towards the parents of the children, and possibly the children themselves if they so wished, attending the hospital for a scan. Hence, I aim that this website (layout, content) is designed in a way that a child could understand, but still possess credibility and instills trust in their parents that the information they are reading is accurate and dependable.

#### Nav
- Nav appears as dropdown to right of header.
- Nav chosen to be displayed as dropdown to ease responsiveness and consistency of each page header at different screen sizes. 
- While a bootstrap element, font awesome icon chosen by developer instead of pre-defined text. Icon chosen to steer wesbite towards more intuitive layout. This symbol was well-known to the developer through other websites they had visited previously and hence developer believe other users would know this symbol contained the navigation bar. 
- A downside of using this boostrap element was that it could not be styled by the developer. As this was the devloper's first time using bootstrap, they were not 100% comfortable using and and adapting elelments to the page. 
- In future, the developer would like to add add their own dropdown code and style accordingly to completely match website color scheme.
