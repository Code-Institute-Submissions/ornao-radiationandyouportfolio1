# Radiation & You

## Introduction

The purpose of this website is to give the user a brief and simple overview of the basics of radiation. As a trained healthcare professional in the radiology department, I have the knowledge and understanding of how radiation is used in hospitals; and I would like to share this information through HTML5 and CSS3 to the best of my ability. 

I work full-time in a childrenâ€™s hospital and hence this website will be catered towards the parents of the children, and possibly the children themselves if they so wished, attending the hospital for a scan. Hence, I aim that this website (layout, content) is designed in a way that a child could understand, but still possess credibility and instills trust in their parents that the information they are reading is accurate and dependable.
