# Radiation & You

## Introduction

The purpose of this website is to give the user a brief and simple overview of the basics of radiation. As a trained healthcare professional in the radiology department, I have the knowledge and understanding of how radiation is used in hospitals; and I would like to share this information through HTML5 and CSS3 to the best of my ability. 

I work full-time in a children’s hospital and hence this website will be catered towards the parents of the children, and possibly the children themselves if they so wished, attending the hospital for a scan. Hence, I aim that this website (layout, content) is designed in a way that a child could understand, but still possess credibility and instills trust in their parents that the information they are reading is accurate and dependable. 

## Features

There are 5 pages on the website:
- Home (index.html)

#### Nav
- Nav appears as dropdown to right of header.
- Nav chosen to be displayed as dropdown to ease responsiveness and consistency of each page header at different screen sizes. 
- While a bootstrap element, font awesome icon chosen by developer instead of pre-defined text. Icon chosen to steer wesbite towards more intuitive layout. This symbol was well-known to the developer through other websites they had visited previously and hence developer believe other users would know this symbol contained the navigation bar. 
- A downside of using this boostrap element was that it could not be styled by the developer. As this was the devloper's first time using bootstrap, they were not 100% comfortable using and and adapting elelments to the page. 
- In future, the developer would like to add add their own dropdown code and style accordingly to completely match website color scheme.

### Main image and cover text

#### Main image 
- Cartoon style x-ray of human body as the developed wanted the website assessible to children (as they form part of the target audience). 
- Inclusion of a form of radiation (x-ray) and human body (x-rayed skeleton) was important to the developer for the title 'Radiation & You' to be tied in. Hence, this particular image was chosen as the main image. 
- Orginal image was somewhat muted and bland so developer increased satruation to match bright colour scheme of rest of site. 

#### Cover Text
- Cover text consists of one h1 and one h2 element.
- h1 element states the title of the site and h2 elemnt gives a brief description of the site to further explain and tie in main image and title. The inclusion of all these elements leaves the user in no doubt to what the site is about. 
- Circle in amber-yellow was chosen in omage to well-know radiation symbol and ties in with logo: hover. 
- The developer played with the idea of including a Begin button within the cover-text but decided a guide would give the user more versility instead. 

### Guide 
- Provides nav on home page for users that may not know of hamburger.
- Orginally designed wesbite without it but during testing realised users might feel a bit lost as the pages are not listed on first display.

### Radiation types (3)

- Used flex box to style boxes.
- Created shadow effect behind boxes and feels this adds a nice touch to website.
- Images again were of the cartoonish style as the website was designed with children in mind but in my opinion these still appeared professional enough for parents to engage with.

### Radon map iframe

- Included iframe map as an element of user interaction if they were interested in checking where their house was loacted in relation to radon gas levels.
- Iframe tended to draw focus of the page which interupted the user experience. This was a bug I resolved.
