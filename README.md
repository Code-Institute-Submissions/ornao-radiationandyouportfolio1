# Radiation & You

<a href="https://ornao.github.io/radiationandyouportfolio1/">Deployed Website</a>

The purpose of this website is to give the user a brief and simple overview of the basics of radiation. As a trained healthcare professional in the radiology department, I have the knowledge and understanding of how radiation is used in hospitals; and I would like to share this information through HTML5 and CSS3 to the best of my ability. 

I work full-time in a childrenâ€™s hospital and hence this website will be catered towards children and their parents. Hence, I aim that this website (layout, content) is designed in a way that a child could understand, but still possess credibility and instills trust in parents that the information they are reading is accurate and dependable. 

Project Goals:
- Create a resource that explains radiation and its use in hospital in a very simple and visually appealing format 
- This website should include colorful images and simple definitions, should not overwhelm the user with information 
- Important information such as radiation dose risk information should be able to be navigated to directly from the home page

Target audience:
- Parents of children attending the hospital for a scan 
- The children having the scan 
- Anyone interested in a brief understanding of radiation and its use in hospitals

Project Demands: 
- Factual, digestible content
- Detailed explantions when necessary for example in FAQ section
- Clear layout and design
- Multiple navigation elements 

Project Expectataions:
- A MVP within the time-frame and skill-level of developer which meets the goals and demands listed above

## User Experience (UX)

### Structure 

There are 5 pages on the website:
- Home (index.html)
    - Gives user clear understanding of what site is about at a glance. 
    - Provides multiple navigation options for easy access to content throughout the site.
- What Is Radiation? (radiation.html)
    - Gives user simple definitions in an easy to digest format 
    - Gives good nav links 
- How Do We Use Radiation in Medicine? (uses.html)
    - Gives user simple definitions in an easy to digest format 
    - Gives good nav links

    - Provides key info in a simple and easy to understand way 
    - Gives good nav links
- FAQs (questions.html)
    - Gives user option to contact site owner 
    - Provides good nav links within page
    - Outlines detailed answers to possible questions

### Design 

#### Colour

Amber-yellow and dark-turquoise were the main colors used for designing the site. Amber-yellow is a colour associated with the radiation symbol and hence I believed was appropriate to be used in this site because of that connotation. Dark-turquoise is the color of the main-image and hence for consistency of design was used across site in different ways to tie together features. These colours are bright and vivid which is visiually appealing for children. Moreover, the fact that two main colors were chosen gives a simplicity and professionalism to the wesbite that would appeal to parents. Other neutral colours were used for other elements to not overwhelm the design. The dark-turquoise colour was made darker to allow for better contrast-ratio to mitigate acessibility concerns. 

#### Font

Roboto and Montserrat were the fonts chosen for the website. I had previously looked up most popular fonts for use in educational website and both these fonts were in the top 10.

<a href="https://www.ilovewp.com/resources/education/wordpress-for-schools/most-used-google-fonts-on-school-websites/">Website link here</a>

#### Images

Images of the wesbite were very important for giving an overall inviting, fun, educational feel to the wesbite which is important for both children and their parents which whom this site is aimed at. I spent many hours scrolling through Pexels, Unsplash and finally Freepik to find the type of descriptive applicable images I wanted. Futher explanation of choice of image for a particular section is detailed below in features. 

#### Content 

Content aimed to give a basic overview of radiation and its uses for children and their parents. Hence, simple definitions and limited text were utilised to avoid overwhelming the users. Website content adapted with permission from poster approved by CHI Radiation Safety Committee (October 2019). Original produced by the Radiation Safety Committee, CHI at Crumlin, Version 1d (January 2017).

#### Main image 
- Cartoon style x-ray of human body as the developed wanted the website assessible to children (as they form part of the target audience). 
- Inclusion of a form of radiation (x-ray) and human body (x-rayed skeleton) was important to the developer for the title 'Radiation & You' to be tied in. Hence, this particular image was chosen as the main image. 
- Original image was somewhat muted and bland so developer increased satruation to match bright colour scheme of rest of site. 
- Hence, the user is clear about what the site is about at first glance and brief look. 

#### Cover Text
- h1 element states the title of the site and h2 elemnt gives a brief description of the site to further explain and tie in main image and title. The inclusion of all these elements leaves the user in no doubt to what the site is about.

### Future Features
- Dropdown menu 
    - While a bootstrap element, font awesome icon chosen by developer instead of pre-defined text. Icon chosen to steer wesbite towards more intuitive layout. This symbol was well-known to the developer through other websites they had visited previously and hence developer believe other users would know this symbol contained the navigation bar. 
    - A downside of using this boostrap element was that it could not be styled by the developer. As this was the devloper's first time using bootstrap, they were not 100% comfortable using and and adapting elelments to the page. 
    - In future, the developer would like to add add their own dropdown code and style accordingly to completely match 
    website color scheme.
- Begin button in main image
   - A further navigation element that could triiger the dropdown menu so users do not need to scroll down for guide 
   - This button could help someone if they were not familar with a hamburger dropdown menu also

### Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|x-ray image was pushed to one side on smaller screens in uses. html| used dev tools to help find and remove margin-left: 10% that was causing the issue |
|h1 element had large gap between header and itself compared to other pages| used dev tools to help find and remove padding-top: 40px that was causing the issue|
|h1 elemnt background appearing out of circle on smaller screen level on home page | changed padding to get rid of this ruining of circle |

#### Unresolved Bug
- Iframe draws focus of the page which interupts the user experience. This was a bug that could easily be resolved with Java. I intend to fix this once I learn that language. 
- Logo:hover makes main image jump when clicked, should increase margin between image and header. 

## Deployment
- Used github paged to deploy site
- Went to settings tab of respository I intended to submit which is last header on right top of page section
- Then went to pages tab by scrolling and looking towrds left hand side of screen 
- Pressed deploy from branch and save
- Waited for link to appear
