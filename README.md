# Radiation & You

The purpose of this website is to give the user a brief and simple overview of the basics of radiation. As a trained healthcare professional in the radiology department, I have the knowledge and understanding of how radiation is used in hospitals; and I would like to share this information through HTML5 and CSS3 to the best of my ability. 

I work full-time in a childrenâ€™s hospital and hence this website will be catered towards the parents of the children, and possibly the children themselves if they so wished, attending the hospital for a scan. Hence, I aim that this website (layout, content) is designed in a way that a child could understand, but still possess credibility and instills trust in parents that the information they are reading is accurate and dependable.

### Design 

#### Colour

Amber-yellow and dark-turquoise were the main colors used for designing the site. Amber-yellow is a colour associated with the radiation symbol and hence I believed was appropriate to be used in this site because of that connotation. Dark-turquoise is the color of the main-image and hence for consistency of design was used across site in different ways to tie together features. These colours are bright and vivid which is visiually appealing for children. Moreover, the fact that two main colors were chosen gives a simplicity and professionalism to the wesbite that would appeal to parents. Other neutral colours were used for other elements to not overwhelm the design. 

#### Font

Roboto and Montserrat were the fonts chosen for the website. I had previously looked up most popular fonts for use in educational website and both these fonts were in the top 10.

#### Images

Images of the wesbite were very important for giving an overall inviting, fun, educational feel to the wesbite which is important for both children and their parents which whom this site is aimed at. I spent many hours scrolling through Pexels, Unsplash and finally Freepik to find the type of descriptive applicable images I wanted. Futher explanation of choice of image for a particular section is detailed below in features. 

#### Content 

Content aimed to give a basic overview of radiation and its uses for children and their parents. Hence, simple definitions and limited text were utilised to avoid overwhelming the users.

#### Nav
- Nav appears as dropdown to right of header.
- Nav chosen to be displayed as dropdown to ease responsiveness and consistency of each page header at different screen sizes. 
- While a bootstrap element, font awesome icon chosen by developer instead of pre-defined text. Icon chosen to steer wesbite towards more intuitive layout. This symbol was well-known to the developer through other websites they had visited previously and hence developer believe other users would know this symbol contained the navigation bar. 
- A downside of using this boostrap element was that it could not be styled by the developer. As this was the devloper's first time using bootstrap, they were not 100% comfortable using and and adapting elelments to the page. 
- In future, the developer would like to add add their own dropdown code and style accordingly to completely match website color scheme.

### Main image and cover text
- User stories covered: 1, 3, 11
<img src="assets/docs/features/main-image--cover-text.png" alt="main image and cover text displayed">

#### Main image 
- Cartoon style x-ray of human body as the developed wanted the website assessible to children (as they form part of the target audience). 
- Inclusion of a form of radiation (x-ray) and human body (x-rayed skeleton) was important to the developer for the title 'Radiation & You' to be tied in. Hence, this particular image was chosen as the main image. 
- Original image was somewhat muted and bland so developer increased satruation to match bright colour scheme of rest of site. 

#### Cover Text
- Cover text consists of one h1 and one h2 element.
- h1 element states the title of the site and h2 elemnt gives a brief description of the site to further explain and tie in main image and title. The inclusion of all these elements leaves the user in no doubt to what the site is about. 
- Circle in amber-yellow was chosen in omage to well-know radiation symbol and ties in with logo: hover. 
- The developer played with the idea of including a Begin button within the cover-text but decided a guide would give the user more versility instead. 

### Guide

- Orginally designed wesbite without it but during testing realised users might feel a bit lost as the page titles are not listed on first display.
