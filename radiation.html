        <h2>What is radiation?</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Radiation is <span>energy</span> that is all around us every minute of every day.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>We are exposed to radiation in three main ways:</h3>
        <br>
        <div id="sun">
            <h3>Sun <i class="fa-solid fa-sun"></i></h3>
            <img src="assets/images/sunc.jpg" alt="picture of sun in sky with clouds underneath">
            <p>The sun exposes us to cosmic radiation</p>
            <p>
                Flying in a plane increases our exposure to radiation from the sun as we have less protection fromthe earths atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your radiation exposure on a return flight from Dublin to New York is the same as the exposure from having two or three chest x-rays.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="food">
            <h3>Food <i class="fa-solid fa-utensils"></i></h3>
            <img src="assets/images/food.jpg" alt="woman holding shopping basket in grocery ailse">
            <p>Radiation, in the form of radioactivity, is found in many foods.</p>
            <p>For example, bananas contain small amounts of a radioactive substance called Potassium-40.</p>
            <p>This means that you are very slightly radioactive at all times!</p>
        </div>
        <div id="gas">
            <h3>Radon Gas <i class="fa-solid fa-hill-rockslide"></i></h3>
            <img src="assets/images/rocks.jpg" alt="pictures of rocks clumped together on ground">
            <p>Radon gas orginates from the rocks and soil beneath our feet. </p>
            <p>In Ireland, most of our radiation exposure comes from breathing Radon gas.</p>
            <p>Depending on where you live, your exposure to Radon gas can go up or down.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>These forms of radiation (<i class="fa-solid fa-sun"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-utensils"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-hill-rockslide"></i>) are collectively termed "Background Radiation"</h2>
            <br>
            <h2>
                On average, people living in Ireland are exposed to 4mSv of background radiation per year 
            </h2>
            <br>
            <h2>(mSv is shorthand for millSievert which is how we measure radiation exposure)</h2>
