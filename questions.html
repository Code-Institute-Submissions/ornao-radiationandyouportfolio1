        <div id="bubble-text1"><h2>Are there any risks associated with my child’s x-ray examination?</h2>
        <p>It is well known that exposure to high levels of radiation (greater than 100mSv) is associated with an increased risk of getting cancer. However, for exposures below this value, no link with cancer induction has ever been conclusively demonstrated.  Many of the examinations undertaken in a Radiology department result in a dose of radiation much less than 1mSv, with the majority of exams measuring less than 10mSv.

        <div id="bubble-text2"><h2>What are the benefits of having an x-ray examination?
        </h2><p>Many diseases can only be diagnosed by an x-ray examination (e.g. pneumonia). In some cases, the development of more complex examinations and treatments using x-ray, such as cardiac catheterisation, have radically improved the quality of life and life expectancy of thousands of children (e.g. those born with life threatening heart conditions). Your doctor will only refer your child for an x-ray examination when they believe that the benefit of having the exam outweighs the small potential risk. This practice of weighing the benefit against the risk applies to all aspects of medicine and extends to all aspects of your child’s care.

        <div id="bubble-text1"><h2>Where can I find more detailed information about radiation exposures in medicine? 
        </h2><p>Both the “Image Gently” and “Health Physics” websites answer many of the questions parents have about their child’s radiation exposure.
            They can be accessed at – http://www.imagegently.org/ and www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/
