                    <h3>Are there any risks associated with my childs x-ray examination?</h3>
                    <p>It is well known that exposure to high levels of radiation (greater than 100mSv) is associated
                        with
                        an increased risk of getting cancer. However, for exposures below this value, no link with
                        cancer
                        induction has ever been conclusively demonstrated. Many of the examinations undertaken in a
                        Radiology department result in a dose of radiation much less than 1mSv, with the majority of
                        exams
                        measuring less than 10mSv.

                    <h3>What are the benefits of having an x-ray examination?
                    </h3>
                    <p>Many diseases can only be diagnosed by an x-ray examination (e.g. pneumonia). In some cases, the
                        development of more complex examinations and treatments using x-ray, such as cardiac
                        catheterisation, have radically improved the quality of life and life expectancy of thousands of
                        children (e.g. those born with life threatening heart conditions). Your doctor will only refer
                        your
                        child for an x-ray examination when they believe that the benefit of having the exam outweighs
                        the
                        small potential risk. This practice of weighing the benefit against the risk applies to all
                        aspects
                        of medicine and extends to all aspects of your child’s care.

                    </h3>
                    <p>Both the “Image Gently” and “Health Physics” websites answer many of the questions parents have
                        about
                        their childs radiation exposure.
