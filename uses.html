        <h2> Radiation is a very useful tool in medicine. </h2>
        <br>
        <h2> It is usually used in the form of X-RAYs or, in Nuclear Medicine, GAMMA RAYS. </h2>
        <br>
        <h2> Both allow us to see inside the human body. </h2>
        <br>
        <h2>Both can help doctors assess injuries and diseases in a quick
            and easy manner. </h2>
